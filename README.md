HTML, CSS, and JS were used in the development of this online grocery buying platform's website. Only frontend coding languages are used in this project. We will work together to improve this group project. We would appreciate any input on the project. As a last step, I will upload the images used in this project. Since we entered the images using URLs, there shouldn't be a need to add them again, but we will still post the images for reference.
